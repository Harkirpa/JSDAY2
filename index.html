    <h3>
        Question 1. What is execution context?
    </h3>
    <h4>
        When the JavaScript engine scans a script file, it makes an environment called the Execution Context that
        handles the entire transformation and execution of the code.
        During the context runtime, the parser parses the source code and allocates memory for the variables and
        functions. The source code is generated and gets executed.
    </h4>
    <p>
        There are two types of execution contexts: global and function. <br>
        a. The global execution context is created when a JavaScript script first starts to run, and it represents the
        global scope in JavaScript. <br>
        b . A function execution context is created whenever a function is called, representing the function's local
        scope.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
        Question 2.What is an event loop and call stack
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Answer . In JavaScript, the event loop and call stack are two key concepts that determine how code is executed
        in the
        language.
    </h4>
    <p>
        1. The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the function calls in a program. <br>
        2. Whenever a function is called, it is added to the top of the call stack, and when the function completes, it
        is removed from the top of the stack. <br>
        3. This allows JavaScript to keep track of where it is in a program's execution and which function to return to
        after the current one finishes.
        <br>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Question 3. What is creation phase and execution phase?
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Answer. The creation phase includes creating the global and function execution contexts, creating the scope
        chain, and allocating memories for the variables and functions. During the execution phase, the JavaScript
        engine executes the code line by line. This includes evaluating and executing statements
    </h4>
    <h3>
        Question 4. What is the spread operator?
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Answer. The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or
        object into another array or object
    </h4>
    <h3> Question 5.use of setTimeout()</h3>
    <h4>The setTimeout() method calls a function after a number of milliseconds.

        1 second = 1000 milliseconds.The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function 
        or specified piece of code once the timer expires</h4>
    
        <pre>let timeout;

            function myFunction() {
              timeout = setTimeout(alertFunc, 3000);
            }
            
            function alertFunc() {
              alert("Hello!");
            }</pre>
            <h3>  Question 6. What are callbacks?
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Answer. A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished
        execution. A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so
        that it
        can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.
    </h4>
    <h3>  Question 7. What are callback hell?
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Answer. Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback,
         thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code.
    </h4>
    <h3>Question 8- Difference between undefined vs not defined vs Nan</h3>
   <h4>undefined- It is a JavaScript keyword that has a special meaning. Everything which gets a 
    space in memory will contain undefined until we assign a value to that memory space.
    not defined: In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors that JavaScript
     will throw when someone accesses the variable which is not inside the memory heap.
     In JavaScript, NaN is short for "Not-a-Number".

     In JavaScript, NaN is a number that is not a legal number.
     
     The Number.isNaN() method returns true if the value is NaN, and the type is a Number</h4>
